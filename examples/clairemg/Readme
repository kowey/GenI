The grammar n0Vn1semt.mg associates 45 trees with the class
n0Vn1nonpassivable

The testuite n0Vn1sem.ts lists an example sentence for each of these
45 trees

semlex and synlex specify the lexicon for the words entering in the
n0Vn1sem.ts sentences

looksem specifies the input which should generate all 45
configurations -- it also specifies a feature cleft(j) on which the
ability of GenI to select a certain paraphrase can be tested. When
using it the only output (on all 4 inputs given in looksem) should be:

      C'est Jean qui regarde Marie
